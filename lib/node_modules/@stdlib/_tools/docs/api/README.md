This directory contains various tooling required to build project API documentation. To generate a local build, enter the following command from the top-level project directory,

```bash
$ DEBUG=* node ./path/to/docs/api/build-docs/bin/cli
```

To view generated docs, open a second terminal and navigate to

```bash
$ cd ./path/to/stdlib/build/www/public
```

Once in the build destination directory, run

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHttpServer 9000
```

and open

```text

```

in a browser.
