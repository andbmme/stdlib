# Determine root directory:
root="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Define the path to a utility to compute commit sizes:
commit_sizes="${root}/tools/git/scripts/commit_sizes"

# Define the path to a utility to compute the arithmetic mean:
mean="${root}/tools/awk/mean.awk"

# * `commit_sizes`
#   - Compute commit sizes.
# * `mean`
#   - Compute the mean.
