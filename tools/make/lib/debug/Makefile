# RULES #

#/
# Prints the runtime value of a `Makefile` variable.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make inspect.<variable>
#     ```
#
# @example
# make inspect.ROOT_DIR
#
# @example
# make inspect.CC
#/
inspect.%:
	$(QUIET) echo '$*=$($*)'

#/
# Asserts that a `Makefile` variable is set.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make assert.<variable>
#     ```
#
# -   If a variable is **not** set, the recipe exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# @example
# make inspect.CXX
#/
assert.%:
	$(QUIET) if [[ "${${*}}" = "" ]]; then \
		echo "\nError: You must set the environment variable: ${*}.\n"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi

#/
# Prints a sorted list of `Makefile` variable names.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The list of variables is **not** exhaustive, as the list does **not** include built-in variables. Built-in variables could be included by dumping the `Makefile` database via `make -qp`.
# -   To remove duplicates, pipe to `uniq`.
#
# @example
# make list-variables
#/
